# Email Dot Insertion Generator

This Python script generates all possible email addresses by inserting dots at various positions within the username part of a given email address. The script ensures that dots are not placed at the start or end of the username and can handle cases where the requested number of email addresses (`n`) exceeds the total number of possible combinations.

## Features

- **Generates All Possible Combinations**: Inserts dots at all possible positions within the username.
- **Handles Large `n` Values**: Limits output to the total number of possible combinations if `n` exceeds the number of generated addresses.
- **Output to File**: Saves the generated email addresses to a text file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable) or download the script file directly.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-dot-insertion-generator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd email-dot-insertion-generator
   ```

## Usage

1. **Edit the Script**:

   Open the `generate_emails.py` file in your text editor and update the `n` and `email` variables as needed.

   ```python
   n = 100  # Number of email addresses to generate
   email = "goldenwizzards6@gmail.com"
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:

   Execute the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python generate_emails.py
   ```

   If using Python 3 and the above command doesn’t work, try:

   ```bash
   python3 generate_emails.py
   ```

3. **Check the Output**:

   After running the script, a file named `generated_emails.txt` will be created in the same directory. This file will contain the generated email addresses, each on a new line.

## Example

Given the email `goldenwizzards6@gmail.com` and `n = 10`, the script might produce the following output in `generated_emails.txt`:

```
1: goldenw.izz.ards6@gmail.com
2: goldenw.izz.ard.s6@gmail.com
3: goldenw.izz.ard6@gmail.com
...
```

## Notes

- Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.
- The number of generated email addresses may be less than `n` if there are fewer possible combinations than requested.
